## Why tiers?

The project itself is hard enough, but when plugins / addons are added it creates a new dimension of complexity.  
The more complex an addon is, the more resources it would use on our end.

## Will any of this be Pay to Win?

The workshop isn't the primary focus of the game, therefore not a major influence to someone when they consider to play the game or not.  
That said, I (fallen) intend to make the additions to the game fair and not unbalanced to the rest of the game.
